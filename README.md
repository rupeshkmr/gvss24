# GVSS Assignment

Make sure that [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/), [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) are installed. Ideally, these should be installed by your package manager rather than manually (at least, if you are on Linux or Mac).

Then compile the code using the standard CMake procedure:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
